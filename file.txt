The spider monkey spins no web,
he swings from branch to branch instead.

His legs and arms are long and spindly,
and he moves with speed and nimbly.

He leaps and turns and somersaults,
perfect like an acrobat, no faults.

It doesn’t faze the flies one bit,
who keep attacking him with hits.

Ferociously they fly like darts
biting hard his tasty body parts.

From head to feet they leave a trail
down from head to prehensile tail.

Poor spider monkey, it’s enough!
How to ward these nasties off?

His strategy is quick simple: swat!
to each he says, take this, take that!

The victory won, it’s time to preen,
(spider monkeys have good hygiene.)

Then, in satisfaction so well won,
he picks each off and eats each one.
